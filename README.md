# Plainspeak

**Humanizer meets Orwell: human voice, real meaning.**

Plainspeak humanizes AI writing, applies Orwell's plainness, and adds a tolerance layer that keeps domain and technical terms intact. It is safe for scientific and technical prose: it preserves numbers, units, and citations instead of flattening them.

## What it catches

It catches the tells below (see [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the full catalog):

- **Inflated content:** significance inflation, notability name-dropping, promotional language, superficial -ing analyses, formulaic "challenges" sections.
- **Padded language:** AI vocabulary, copula avoidance ("serves as" for "is"), filler phrases, excessive hedging, generic positive conclusions.
- **Formulaic structure:** negative parallelism, rule of three, false ranges, synonym cycling, manufactured punchlines, aphorism formulas, rhetorical openers.
- **Hidden actors:** passive voice and subjectless fragments, vague attributions ("experts believe").
- **Formatting tells:** em and en dashes, boldface overuse, inline-header lists, title-case headings, emojis, curly quotes.
- **Chatbot residue:** collaborative artifacts ("I hope this helps"), knowledge-cutoff disclaimers, sycophantic tone.

## How it differs from humanizer

Plainspeak is a fork of [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) and keeps its pattern catalog. The difference is register: humanizer was built for blog and essay voice and tends to add a conversational lift, while Plainspeak keeps reference prose plain.

Two AI-generated sentences, each run through both skills (Claude Opus 4.8, clean sessions).


| Original (AI) | humanizer | Plainspeak |
|---|---|---|
| Beyond coordination, small teams benefit from stronger ownership and fewer process constraints. | Coordination isn't the whole story, though. Small teams also tend to have stronger ownership and a lot less process. | Small teams also tend to have stronger ownership and lighter process. |

Humanizer adds a conversational hook ("isn't the whole story, though"), appropriate for essays and opinion writing. Plainspeak just states the point.

| Original (AI) | humanizer | Plainspeak |
|---|---|---|
| ...speed comes not from working harder but from removing the friction that size inevitably introduces. | The speed doesn't come from working harder. It comes from not having to deal with the friction that size brings. | ...the speed comes from cutting friction rather than working harder. |

Humanizer breaks the "not X but Y" into a two-sentence reveal, appropriate for essays and opinion writing. Plainspeak folds it into one plain clause.


## Installation

### Claude Code

Clone directly into Claude Code's skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/saraya209/plainspeak.git ~/.claude/skills/plainspeak
```

Or copy the skill file manually if you already have this repo cloned:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/plainspeak
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/plainspeak/
```

### OpenCode

Clone directly into OpenCode's skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills
git clone https://github.com/saraya209/plainspeak.git ~/.config/opencode/skills/plainspeak
```

Or copy the skill file manually if you already have this repo cloned:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/plainspeak
cp SKILL.md ~/.config/opencode/skills/plainspeak/
```

> **Note:** OpenCode also scans `~/.claude/skills/` for compatibility, so if you use both tools, a single clone into `~/.claude/skills/plainspeak/` is enough.

## Usage

### Claude Code

```
/plainspeak

[paste your text here]
```

### OpenCode

```
/plainspeak

[paste your text here]
```

Or ask the model to humanize text directly in either tool:

```
Please humanize this text: [your text]
```

### Voice Calibration

To match your personal writing style, provide a sample of your own writing:

```
/plainspeak

Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching:
[paste 2-3 paragraphs of your own writing]

Now humanize this text:
[paste AI text to humanize]
```

The skill will analyze your sentence rhythm, word choices, and quirks, then apply them to the rewrite instead of producing generic "clean" output.

## Credits

Plainspeak is a fork of [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) (Siqi Chen, MIT), whose pattern catalog is built on [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by [WikiProject AI Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup). The plainness and honesty come from George Orwell's "Politics and the English Language" (1946), used as paraphrased principles.

## Version History

- **1.0.0** - Initial Plainspeak release, forked from humanizer 2.8.0. Renamed and refocused as "humanizer meets Orwell": added an Orwell lens (six rules plus a positive plain-prose model), softened the personality section so plain and honest is the default, and added a scientific and technical tolerance layer (keep domain terms, methods-section passive voice, numbers, units, and citations). The 33-pattern catalog is unchanged.
